# Memory Game
A Memory Game! Players will be show a collectio of cards, facedown, and can click on a card to reveal what's underneath. After clicking on two cards, the game should check whether they match. If they do, they will remain face up. If not, the cards should remain displayed for one second and then flip back down. 
The goal is to match up all the pairs.
